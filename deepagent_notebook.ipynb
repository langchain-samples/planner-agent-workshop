    "This notebook demonstrates the transition from LangChain v1 core agents to **Deep Agents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Deep Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Agents are an \"agent harness\" built on top of LangGraph that come with built-in capabilities for complex, multi-step tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📋 **Planning**: `write_todos` tool for task decomposition\n",
    "- 📁 **File System**: `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` for context management\n",
    "- 🤖 **Subagents**: `task` tool for delegating work to specialized agents\n",
    "- 🧠 **Context Management**: Automatic eviction of large tool results and conversation summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep agents are inspired by applications like Claude Code, Deep Research, and Manus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Structure\n",
