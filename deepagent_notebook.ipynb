    "## What are Deep Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Agents are an \"agent harness\" built on top of LangGraph that come with built-in capabilities for complex, multi-step tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📋 **Planning**: `write_todos` tool for task decomposition\n",
    "- 📁 **File System**: `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` for context management\n",
    "- 🤖 **Subagents**: `task` tool for delegating work to specialized agents\n",
    "- 🧠 **Context Management**: Automatic eviction of large tool results and conversation summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep agents are inspired by applications like Claude Code, Deep Research, and Manus.\n",

    "# Deep Agents CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Deep Agents CLI** is an interactive command-line interface for building with Deep Agents. It's an open-source coding assistant that runs in your terminal and retains persistent memory across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📁 **File operations** - Read, write, and edit files in your project\n",
    "- 🖥️ **Shell command execution** - Execute shell commands to run tests, build projects, manage dependencies\n",
    "- 🔍 **Web search** - Search the web for up-to-date information (requires Tavily API key)\n",
    "- 🌐 **HTTP requests** - Make HTTP requests to APIs and external services\n",
    "- 📋 **Task planning** - Break down complex tasks into discrete steps with built-in todo system\n",
    "- 🧠 **Memory storage** - Store and retrieve information across sessions, learning project conventions\n",
    "- 👤 **Human-in-the-loop** - Require approval for sensitive tool operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set your API key** (export as environment variable or in `.env` file):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
    "   # Or use OPENAI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the CLI**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Install globally\n",
    "   uv tool install deepagents-cli\n",
    "   deepagents\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Or run without global install\n",
    "   uvx deepagents-cli\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Give the agent a task**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   > Create a Python script that prints \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The agent proposes changes with diffs for your approval before modifying files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Named agents**: Use `--agent NAME` for separate memory per agent\n",
    "- **Auto-approve**: Use `--auto-approve` to skip confirmation prompts (toggle with `Ctrl+T`)\n",
    "- **Resume sessions**: Use `--resume` or `-r` to resume the most recent session\n",
    "- **Remote sandboxes**: Use `--sandbox TYPE` to execute in isolated environments (Modal, Daytona, Runloop)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slash commands**: `/tokens`, `/clear`, `/exit`, `/help`, `/threads`, `/version`\n",
    "- **Bash commands**: Prefix with `!` to execute shell commands directly: `!git status`\n",
    "- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl+E` for external editor, `Shift+Tab` to toggle auto-approve, `@filename` for auto-complete\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory System\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents store information in `~/.deepagents/AGENT_NAME/memories/` as markdown files. The agent:\n",
    "1. **Researches** memory for relevant context before starting tasks\n",
    "2. **Checks** memory when uncertain during execution\n",
    "3. **Learns** by automatically saving new information for future sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you teach the agent conventions:\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Our API uses snake_case and includes created_at/updated_at timestamps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It remembers for future sessions and applies conventions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote Sandboxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute code in isolated remote environments for safety and flexibility:\n",
    "- **Safety**: Protect your local machine from potentially harmful code\n",
    "- **Clean environments**: Use specific dependencies or OS configurations\n",
    "- **Parallel execution**: Run multiple agents simultaneously\n",
    "- **Long-running tasks**: Execute time-intensive operations without blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "Configure and use:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Set up sandbox provider (Runloop, Daytona, or Modal)\n",
    "export RUNLOOP_API_KEY=\"your-key\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run with sandbox\n",
    "uvx deepagents-cli --sandbox runloop --sandbox-setup ./setup.sh\n",
